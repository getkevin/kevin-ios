The kevin. iOS SDK enables to easily integrate AIS and PIS services in your mobile application. We provide neat, customisable UI screens so integration would be as quick as possible. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

If you're a developer:

- Get started with our [SDK reference](https://developer.kevin.eu/home/mobile-sdk/getting-started)
- Get started with our [Developer Portal](https://developer.kevin.eu/home/mobile-sdk/ios)
- Check out our [Samples](https://github.com/getkevin/kevin-ios/tree/master/sample) for an example of how you can easily integrate kevin. iOS SDK for the most common cases

## Features

- **Account linking** - we provide an easy solution to authenticate and manage user bank accounts.
- **Bank payments** - we provide a possibility to integrate bank payments in your app with both SCA and non-SCA options.
- **Card payments** - we also provide card payments with a hybrid payment support, so the payment would be performed via bank if we detect that the card belongs to one of our supported banks.
